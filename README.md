# Imageomics HDR Scientific Mood Challenge Sample

This repository contains training code and submissions for the [2025 HDR Scientific Mood (Modeling out of distribution) Challenge: Beetles as Sentinel Taxa](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/9854/).

## Repository Structure

```

We also recommend that you include a [CITATION.cff](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files) for your work.

**Note:** If you have requirements not included in the [whitelist](https://github.com/Imageomics/HDR-SMood-challenge/blob/main/ingestion_program/whitelist.txt), please check the [issues](https://github.com/Imageomics/HDR-SMood-challenge/issues) on the [challenge GitHub](https://github.com/Imageomics/HDR-SMood-Challenge) to see if someone else has requested it before making your own issue.

#### Training Data Exploration

This repository also includes `train-data-exploration.ipynb` which loads the training data from Hugging Face to perform various data analytics. Specifically, it looks at distributions of images, species, SPEI values, etc. over the various domains. To run this notebook, first clone this repository and create a fresh conda environment, then install the requirements file:

```console
conda create -n beetle-sample -c conda-forge pip -y
conda activate beetle-sample
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

## Installation & Running (for Training)

### Installation
If you have `uv` simply run `uv sync`, otherwise you can use the `requirements.txt` file with either `conda` or `pip`.

### Training
An example training run can be executed by running the following:
```
python baselines/training/train.py
```

with `uv` do:
```
uv run python baselines/training/train.py
```

The training data is available on the Imageomics Hugging Face: [Sentinel Beetles Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/sentinel-beetles). 

### Evaluation
Aftering training, you can locally evaluate your model by running the following:
```
python baselines/training/evaluation.py
```

with `uv` do:
```
uv run python baselines/training/evaluation.py
```
